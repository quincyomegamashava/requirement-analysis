📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Introduction
This repository is part of a structured learning project focused on the Requirement Analysis phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It aims to simulate a real-world development scenario by analyzing and documenting the requirements of a Booking Management System.

The primary goal is to create a detailed, professional blueprint that includes functional and non-functional requirements, system diagrams, use cases, and acceptance criteria. This documentation is designed to enhance clarity, precision, and structure—cornerstones of any successful software project.

🔧 Tools used: Markdown, Draw.io, GitHub
📍 Goal: Industry-standard documentation and real-world planning practice
