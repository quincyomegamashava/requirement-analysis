📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Introduction
This repository is part of a structured learning project focused on the Requirement Analysis phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It aims to simulate a real-world development scenario by analyzing and documenting the requirements of a Booking Management System.

The primary goal is to create a detailed, professional blueprint that includes functional and non-functional requirements, system diagrams, use cases, and acceptance criteria. This documentation is designed to enhance clarity, precision, and structure—cornerstones of any successful software project.

🔧 Tools used: Markdown, Draw.io, GitHub
📍 Goal: Industry-standard documentation and real-world planning practice

## 🔍 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a proposed software system. It acts as the foundation for designing, developing, and delivering a product that aligns with business goals and user expectations.

✅ Key Objectives of Requirement Analysis:
Understand what the users and stakeholders need.

Translate those needs into clear, structured, and actionable requirements.

Identify potential constraints, dependencies, and assumptions.

Ensure alignment between the technical team and business objectives.

🛠 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Reduces Risk of Failure: Clear requirements help avoid misunderstandings and misalignments that often lead to project failures.

Improves Planning & Estimation: Accurate requirements enable better time, cost, and resource estimation.

Enhances Communication: Acts as a reference point for all stakeholders, fostering transparency.

Ensures Quality: Defined requirements provide the basis for testing, validation, and acceptance criteria.

Supports Scalability & Maintenance: A well-documented system is easier to update and scale over time.

🧩 Role in SDLC:
Requirement Analysis is typically the second phase in the SDLC, following project initiation and feasibility studies. It sets the stage for system design, architecture, and development by ensuring a shared understanding of what is to be built before moving into how it will be built.
